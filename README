L2 AUTH
Simple Lineage 2 C4 server written as a learning exercise.
Currently working in WINDOWS & LINUX (thanks to Docker).

RUNNING THE SERVER USING DOCKER
- Install docker & docker-compose
- `docker-compose up`
- Server will start listening to address 127.0.0.1 (local) and port 2106.

WHAT TO EXPECT
Right now, the server will listen for only one connection.
After the client connects and sends a user & password, the server will always send an incorrect user/password packet.
This means, the server is capable of:
- Create socket/connection
- Listen for connections
- Accept connections
- Encrypt connection with RSA & Blowfish
- Send Lineage 2 packets
- Receive Lineage 2 packets

SCREENSHOTS
Please see doc/screenshot.
