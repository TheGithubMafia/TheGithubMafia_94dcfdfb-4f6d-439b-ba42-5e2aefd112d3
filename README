Simple Lineage 2 C4 server emulator written in C as a learning exercise.

Why does this project exist?
----------------------------
Because it's fun; because I like Lineage 2 (at least until C4 and Interlude 
chronicles) and because I like the C programming language and I thought this 
is an excellent project to work with it.

Running the server with Docker
------------------------------
- Install Docker
- Install docker-compose
- Run docker-compose up
- Server will start listening for connections on localhost (127.0.0.1) 
  ports 2106 (loginserver) and 7777 (gameserver)
- Use any user and password (all are valid) and you should be able to log in

Gameserver hot-code reload
--------------------------
It is possible to make changes in the game server code and see those live
without having to restart or shuting down the server. This is possible thanks
to dlfcn.h (dlopen and dlsym).

- Run the game server
- Make a change in the code
- If using Docker run:
        - docker-compose exec gameserver bash update_gs_code.sh
- If not using Docker run:
        - sh update_gs_code.sh
- Check the Lineage 2 client, the change should be reflected live

Lineage 2 Protocol
------------------
Lineage 2 uses TCP to send packets.

All integers are little-endian.

The first two bytes of the packet contain the packet size and the third one, 
usually the packet type.

Other than the first packet, all packets are encrypted with blowfish using 
the following hardcoded key: ;5.]94-31==-%xT!^[$\000.

To do
-----
- [ ] Correctly handle big/little-endian
- [x] Display terms of service view
- [x] Display server list
- [x] Allow to enter game server
- [x] Create character
- [x] Enter world
- [x] Walk
- [x] Handle multiple connections
- [ ] See other players

Screenshots/demos

Awesome! Just open up an issue detailing what you will be working on, this way
we can be more organized with the work. After that, just have fun working on it!
