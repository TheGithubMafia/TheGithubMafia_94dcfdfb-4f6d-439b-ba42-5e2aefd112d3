L2 AUTH
Simple Lineage 2 C4 server written as a learning exercise.
Currently working only in WINDOWS but it is intended to make it work in LINUX as well.

DEPENDENCIES
- OpenSSL (https://www.openssl.org/)

REQUIREMENTS
- cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/)

OPENSSL
To avoid building it, use http://p-nand-q.com/programming/windows/building_openssl_with_visual_studio_2013.html/

RUNNING THE SERVER
- make CFLAGS='-I<path/to/openssl/include/openssl> -L<path/to/openssl-with-dll>'
- ./a.exe

The server will start listening to address 127.0.0.1 (local) and port 2106.

WHAT TO EXPECT
Right now, the server will listen for only one connection.
After the client connects and sends a user & password, the server will always send an incorrect user/password packet.
This means, the server is capable of:
- Create socket/connection
- Listen for connections
- Accept connections
- Encrypt connection with RSA & Blowfish
- Send Lineage 2 packets
- Receive Lineage 2 packets

SCREENSHOTS
Please see doc/screenshot.
