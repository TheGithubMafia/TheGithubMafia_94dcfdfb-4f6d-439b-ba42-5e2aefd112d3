Lineage 2 game server library
-----------------------------

This folder contains the code of the game server's library.
It's exported as a library to allow being loaded at run time, thus,
allowing for hot code reload (code can be recompiled and changes
will be live without having to shutdown/restart the server).

Folders
-------

- client_packet: Contains the packet types the client can send.
- client_request: Contains all the parsers for a client request. This means,
it will convert the raw request (bytes) from the request into a struct.
- server_packet: Contains all the packets sent from the server to the client.
- state_machine: The way sessions and characters are being handled is by
using a state machine.
- storage: Contains the logic for dealing with storage (database). Currently,
only in memory database is implemented, meaning, data will be lost once the
server is taken down. To implement a new driver (for example, postgresql) just
create a new folder and modify the Makefile to use it instead of memory.
